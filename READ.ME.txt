Game Clustering and Analysis Project
This project involves clustering and analyzing video game data for various insights, including genre distributions, owner categories, and gameplay features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering with K-means, and visualizing the results.
Prerequisites
1. Software:
o R version 4.0 or above.
o RStudio (optional but recommended).
2. Packages: Ensure the following R packages are installed:
o dplyr, tidyr, stringr, caTools, caret, lightgbm, ggplot2, data.table, cluster, factoextra, scales, mclust, gridExtra
Install missing packages using:
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "stringr", "caTools", "caret", "lightgbm", "ggplot2", "data.table", "cluster", "factoextra", "scales", "mclust", "gridExtra"))
3. Input Files:
o Cleaned_new_games.csv - Preprocessed game data.
o Cleaned_games_pt4.csv - Intermediate data used for clustering.
Files and Outputs
* Primary Script: Cleaned_games.pt2.R
* Generated Outputs: 
o Cleaned_games_pt3.csv: Intermediate preprocessed data.
o app_data.rds: Clustered data for further use.
o cluster_model.rds: K-means clustering model metadata.
How to Run the Code
Step 1: Data Preparation
1. Load Cleaned_new_games.csv into the script. Update the file path in the line:
2. new_games <- read.csv("Final Project Data/Cleaned_new_games.csv")  # Update this path
3. Run the preprocessing and feature engineering sections to:
o Drop irrelevant columns.
o Engineer new features (e.g., age_rating, owner_category).
o Create binary indicators for gameplay modes and genres.
4. Save intermediate results:
5. write.csv(new_games, "Cleaned_games_pt3.csv", row.names = FALSE)
Step 2: Clustering
1. Ensure Cleaned_games_pt4.csv is available and update the path in:
2. new_games_model <- read.csv("Final Project Data/Cleaned_games_pt4.csv")
3. Run the clustering script to:
o Normalize and scale features.
o Perform K-means clustering with 5 clusters.
4. Save the clustering results:
5. saveRDS(final_app_data, "app_data.rds")
6. saveRDS(model_export, "cluster_model.rds")
Step 3: Visualizations
1. Generate distribution and heatmap plots for:
o Cluster characteristics.
o Genre distribution.
o Age ratings.
o Ownership categories.
2. Example plots include:
o Bar charts of age group distributions.
o Heatmap for feature distributions across clusters.
Step 4: Export and Metrics
1. View clustering metrics, such as explained variance and sum of squares:
2. print("Explained Variance Ratio:", round(cluster_metrics$explained_var, 4))
3. Export important metrics or visualization plots as needed.
Key Outputs and Insights
1. Cluster Assignments:
o Each game is assigned to one of five clusters.
2. Visualizations:
o Distribution plots for multi-player vs. single-player games.
o Heatmap of genre frequencies across clusters.
3. Metrics:
o Explained variance ratio: ~48.39%.
Reproducing Results
1. Download and load the Cleaned_new_games.csv dataset.
2. Follow steps 1 to 4 sequentially.
3. Ensure consistent random seeds (set.seed(123)) for reproducibility.
